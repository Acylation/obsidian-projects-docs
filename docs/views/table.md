# Table View

## Table view 101

Table view lays out your notes in a grid where each row represents a note, and each column represents a property field of your notes. (This just reflects what dataframe is, showing a most plain view of project)

Projects will go through included notes and gather all possible fields to form the table. Except for these, for `folder` based and `tag` based projects, two mandatory columns, `name` and `path` are added to let you identify each note. Projects build with a Dataview query will have a extra `File` column, staying the same as Dataview code blocks. (However, `without id` doesn't work for Projects)


## Modify contents

Under table view, you can modify cells. For text, multi-text, date/datetime and nubmer fields, you can activate them by double click or press enter on a focused cell, then the value becomes editable. For
