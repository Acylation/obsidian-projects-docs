# Projects settings

## Project size limit

To avoid unexpected long indexing and rendering time, Projects plugin has applied a default maximum note count of 1,000 for each project. You can adjust this to fit your own need.
## Link behavior

To let you modify note's properties just in place, Board, Calendar and Gallery views offer a meta data editor pop-out when you `click` / `ctrl + click` on the note link, based on your setting. The opposite action is to open the note itself in a new tab.
## Start week on

By default, Projects will determine the start day of the week based on the locale set in Obsidianâ€™s language settings. You can override this by specifying either Monday or Sunday. This change will affect the week, 2-week, and month modes the Calendar view.
