Projects is a community plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) letting you manage note-based projects. By gathering Properties from a certain set of notes, and visualize them in various perspectives, this plugin helps you manage your projects intuitively.

## Features

- Collect notes by [folder](./data-sources/folder), [tags](./data-sources/tags), and [Dataview queries](./data-sources/dataview)
- Extract structured data from note properties
- View your project in different [views](./category/views/), including [Table](./views/table), [Board](./views/board), [Calendar](./views/calendar), and [Gallery](./views/gallery)
- Filter, sort, and coloring items

## Quick start

1. [Install Projects plugin](./getting-started/installation)
2. [Open Projects pane](./getting-started/open) via ribbon icon / command palatte
3. (Optional) Try a [demo project](./demo). You will have chance to try this when you open the Projects pane, if you haven't create any project yet
4. [Create a new project](./project/create)
5. [Create views](./views/manage)
## Next steps
